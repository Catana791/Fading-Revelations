  "details": "An eerie silence looms over a canyon, a tension so palpable that anyone could have not only seen it but cut it with a knife as well, for this was a final stand, one that would dictate the fate of a planet. The battle that would occur later would be considered by many to be not even a 'battle' at all, more resembling a massacre than an even fight, but what makes this 'battle' not truly lost is a unit that stood above all, one that a renewed determination to continue the fight, one that would that while having lost the 'battle' would truly earn its name. \n \n Although having lost the 'battle' and the main core, it proved to whatever controlled the HIVE that the militaries of the Cluster can make a stand albeit barely and that their 'planet killer' was not only vulnerable but capable of being destroyed aswell. \n \n However the primary effect of the engagement occurred on the planet itself, but rather on the rest of the Cluster, despite a tense arms race for total dominance already taking place, the devastating engagement have fueled the fires of innovation further and further than ever before, less this a simple fire, more it is a cluster spanning inferno that is engulfing more and more worlds. \n \n The final stand of the main core did not end the fears of collapse, but rather it has accelerated it. The future of the next generations is becoming increasingly uncertain as the inferno spreads further. But if there is any hope for salvation it is found on a planet sparked the discovery of Living metal, none other than Serpulo itself. But a race against time has begun for anyone or anything that wishes to achieve salvation, for the revelations are fading away as time goes on, it is only a matter of time whether or not salvation can be achieved.  However despite all odds many have taken their chances at doing so.",
